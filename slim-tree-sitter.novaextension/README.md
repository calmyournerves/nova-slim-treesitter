# Slim template syntax highlighting extension for Nova

Provides language support for [Slim](https://slim-template.github.io/), a lightweight templating engine for Ruby.

This is based on [tree-sitter-slim](https://github.com/kolen/tree-sitter-slim) and adapted here for the Nova text editor.

With inspiration from [nova-perl-treesitter](https://github.com/mrsdizzie/nova-perl-treesitter).
